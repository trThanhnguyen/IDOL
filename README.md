## **Abstract**

This work introduces **IDOL**, a feed-forward, single-image human reconstruction framework that is fast, high-fidelity, and generalizable. 
Leveraging a large-scale dataset of 100K multi-view subjects, our method demonstrates exceptional generalizability and robustness in handling diverse human shapes, cross-domain data, severe viewpoints, and occlusions. 
With a uniform structured representation, the reconstructed avatars are directly animatable and easily editable, providing a significant step forward for various applications in graphics, vision, and beyond.

In summary, this project introduces:

- **IDOL**: A scalable pipeline for instant photorealistic 3D human reconstruction using a simple yet efficient feed-forward model.
- **HuGe100K Dataset**: We develop a data generation pipeline and present \datasetname, a large-scale multi-view human dataset featuring diverse attributes, high-fidelity, high-resolution appearances, and a well-aligned SMPL-X model.
- **Application Support**: Enabling 3D human reconstruction and downstream tasks such as editing and animation.
